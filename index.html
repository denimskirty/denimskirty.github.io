			<p>This is the literature I’ve been consuming in the past month. I guess they fall in the category of thriller, but the cover has to look like that. These books cycle in and out of the “most read this week” shelf of the thriller genre in goodreads. Verity by Colleen Hoover and the Guest List by Lucy Foley seem to be permanently affixed there. (So is A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder but it doesn’t count because that's YA about high schoolers and the possibility of an extramarital affair is an absolute necessity in these.) I haven’t read those yet though. I’m just subversive and different like that. I go through phases where I think I should read more classics or memoirs or historical or “serious stuff” rather than books like these, who tf do I think I’m kidding. This is home for me. I put these 3 particular books in this order because they represent a spectrum from “class” to “trash”. “Class” as in the more realistic, more well-written, more well-researched, containing the more relatable characters, and “trash” as in the opposite of those things and an ABSOLUTE JOY TO READ.</p>
			<p>The Inmate by Freida McFadden is in the “most trash” slot, but this is not something to mourn. My queen Freida has published 15 books since 2020, and most of them are titled like this (The Coworker, The Teacher, The Wife Upstairs, The Housemaid, The Perfect Son). She will absolutely pull off a twist or two at the end of a book that you won’t see coming, mostly because there is no logical way it could’ve happened like that. Against all odds (plagiarism allegations) she keeps chugging, and you have to respect the hustle.</p>
			<p>Btw, I hate the word “classy”. It automatically sounds classist and also British somehow. In my dopamine detox-curious era (DEBUNKED, FRAUDULENT) my youtube recommendations was filled with other grifter content like “How to be a classy man/woman” and it’s just like. Wear a blazer and don’t chew with your mouth open. Like ok who cares. What does classy even mean? Is it an appearance thing or a personality thing or purely a wealth thing? The definition of classy is “stylish and sophisticated” but those words are also pretty much meaningless. Ok so this is now going to circle back to my newfound hatred for Formula 1. (You should’ve seen it coming at the mention of the British.) If there’s one thing (mostly male) Formula 1 fans love to do, it’s to call a driver a “class act” for doing literally nothing. He took his sunglasses off when he was thanking someone so they could actually see his face? What a class act. He doesn’t curse out his engineer over a penalty that was his own fault? Absolute class. He’s tired from racing (the job that he chose and thousands dream to have) but he’s still smiling in the interview after? CLASS. (Sources: youtube comment about Sebastian Vettel, facebook post about Daniel Riccardo, tiktok about Charles Leclerc) I have the PROOF or you can just go to the comments section of any post-race drivers reaction video on the official F1 youtube channel and you will be bombarded. I googled “Formula 1 driver class act” to find my examples, and it is downright concerning how many results there are. I don’t want to be vulgar on the SFL club email list, but it is some SERIOUS prick-riding. The influx in usage of the word “class” has made it particularly cringe, but I don’t think it was a meaningful characteristic to have in the first place. You are called classy if someone can’t think of any other good thing to say about you maybe. </p>
			<p>On the other hand, I love the word trash. Fun to say, rolls off the tongue. Would you rather be called “trashy” or “classy”? Well I know what I’d pick. One man’s trash is another man’s treasure? What a perfect little saying! And so true. </p>
