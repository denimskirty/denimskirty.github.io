	<h1> Graduation - The worst safeway trip in the world (creative writing piece) </h1>

			<p>The evening after graduation, I go with my mom to Safeway to get groceries and snacks for my brother’s swim meet. Her foot is fractured and she is wearing a boot. On the car ride there, she says something very mean and hurtful that I will not repeat. It is something that she has said before that I have let slide, but this time, maybe because graduation just happened and it is the next chapter of my life, I decide I will rebuke her for it. Unfortunately, I have waited too long and we are already in the store now and I don’t know how to bring it up again. Inexplicably, I start sobbing in the chip aisle, but then I think maybe this is good because when she sees me crying she will ask me why and then there’s my opportunity. She does finally look at my face but by now I have mostly stopped crying and I blow my nose into my shirt which is gross and she tells me that it is really gross. The cat was shedding a lot today she says, it’s in my eyes too.</p>
			<p>After we checkout, we go to return a little bear figurine covered in fake flowers that was supposed to be for me for graduation. When the guy asks the reason for returning it, my mom says “it was going to be for my daughter’s graduation, but she didn’t like it”. UM I NEVER SAID THAT. I liked the bear when I saw it after everyone else did, but my dad thought it was creepy and my brother said it was trypophobia inducing so THEY decided to not give it to me. </p>
			<p>We go back to the car and my mom checks the receipt and realizes she forgot to apply a coupon to the Ben and Jerry's ice cream and goes back to return it and buy it again with the coupon. I would offer to go but I am mad at her and she doesn't ask me to anyway. I wait 10 minutes in the hot car and as I watch her hobble back in pain I think that this is not worth saving 3 dollars.The tonight dough flavor is really good though like everyone says it is. </p>
			<p>As we drive back, my mom says she is really proud of me and that she wishes she wrote something more heartfelt in the card they gave me. I had not expected the card and was really touched by it. She says that my dad's message to me was so much longer and better than hers. She says it is because he has a manager position at his job and is good at communicating to people in ways that makes them feel appreciated. </p>
			<p>Really the whole reason I wanted to go to Safeway with my mom was to start talking to her about things I like and want to talk about. I had just rewatched the Nathan for you episode where he becomes friends with the people who he makes hike up a mountain for free gas, and maybe the graduation speeches about casting light instead of shadow on others and stuff also got to me. I want to start talking to my mom about stuff that isn't grades and my future, which is what we talk about when she initiates the conversation, which is always, so now I will initiate. But when she said that particularly mean thing and I was shocked into silence as I always am, I realized that I have never stood up for myself (or anyone else) in front of her ever, and how can we really have meaningful conversations when I can’t even do that. And also I am scared that I am becoming more like the part of her that says these things, negative and comparative and jealous and cynical and all of the horrible things they said in the graduation speeches. Well it’s already happening because the thought of a graduation speech making any meaningful impact on my life is making my full body cringe and want to pivot and point out all the flaws and things I didn’t like about them. It’s a reflex at this point.</p>
			<p>Anyway that was graduation day, well also I hate-scrolled reels as per my daily routine and had an awkward but at least not tearful lunch at a restaurant with my dad and failed my drivers permit test and now it is the next day. That last sentence makes it seem hopeful, like it is the next day and things can change. But I spent pretty much all of today in bed. But tomorrow is a new day.</p>
