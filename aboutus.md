Denimskirty was born in the defunct Instagram page of a high school literacy club under existential threat. Denimskirty is the result of a passion for Canva, Pinterest, and self-indulgent literary critique. A book blog, if you will. “Book” as in other types of media as well and “blog” as in screaming into the void.

Some facts about denimskirty:
  - Christened by dear friends 
  - Complex relationship with high school english
  - Four hands total
  - Has a shiny luxurious black bob
  - Also a luscious bleach blonde shag
  - Employed and nearly employed
  - Soon to be bicoastal
  - (The dichotomy is crazy)
