Today I will be talking about a book called Age Of Vice by Deepti Kapoor. It is about a dude named Sunny Wadia who is like Kendall Roy kinda, both have billionaire dads who they will never impress and they go through the vicious cycle of trying to defeat their dads and crawling back to them. Oh yeah and they both commit vehicle manslaughter. (kinda spoilers for both sorry.) The book was published early 2023 and was a Good Morning America book club pick, was on Oprah’s top 10 best books of the year, and has been bought by FX to be turned into a TV show. 

This book was one of those books that is so name-droppy. You know the ones. Where the author will not describe the clothes the character is wearing or the drink they are drinking without providing brand names. And it’s never “Old Navy” or “Pepsi”. Never. They have to be super niche with it. Like I really don’t care if a character is wearing a “Langham” bathrobe or “Loro Piana” moccasins. I am NOT looking it up. I usually don’t mind this stuff, it’s easy to ignore like 1 word. It did crack me up when after the important part about the main villain's backstory which leads into the climax of the book, the next chapter starts with a sex scene that the author can’t resist calling “...like that scene from Requiem for a Dream.” Can you try not be esoteric for ONE second. So unserious. 

Here’s a page that gives you a sense of what reading this 548 page book is like:

Like wow thanks I really appreciate the mentioning of 1 illegal bar (that doesn’t exist? I googled this one thing. Did she just want to make the taxes and taxis pun? All other brands mentioned in this book are presumably real), 2 cities that the DJs are from, 3 genres of EDM music, 5 types of recreational drugs, 3 alcohol brands, and 2938751 professions of people who are at this wedding party (it goes onto the next page). I found it so hilarious that the author included Formula 1 drivers on this list, like first of all yass queen I also watched Drive to Survive during the pandemic, second of all, no they would not be here, they are way too protective of their reputation to openly do anything this controversial. (Which there is no point of because they open their big mouths and say the most out-of-touch things ever anyways, so they might as well do stuff like this to at least be interesting.)

I was fixated on Formula 1 last season, it is truly the most fake, unethical, nepotistic, horrible for the environment, misogynistic sport in the entire world and I watched (without paying) in awe of the traveling clown show vibe of it all. The racing sucked last season, of course. This season, the racing still sucks, the same guy is still winning every single race, and the off-track drama of of the sport isn’t fun or funny to watch any more. The married billionaire CEO team principle is gonna get away with (allegedly) inappropriately sexting his female employee and she’s the one that lost her job. The 2 people from the team who want him to resign are a racist and an attempted wife murderer who are pushing for it for solely financial reasons. It is so bleak. Of course it isn’t like the sport is suddenly falling apart this year. It is and has always been run by horrible people. Some sponsors: Marlboro, Russian oligarchs who are friends of Putin, crypto/gambling companies. Like from the internal side it is falling apart AND the sport itself is fake with made-up non-adhered to rules and BORING. And that’s how it felt reading this book. The “glamor” gets so boring and irrational and confusing and the characters are horrible bland people. Just like the Formula 1 drivers! Due to their inherent blandness and the fact that they care so much about what fans think of them as people because they get more money from how they are portrayed on Netflix than their driving skill, I don’t think they would be caught dead at a party like this. I would say Lance Stroll would be the most likely though, his billionaire dad would make him go for some nefarious networking reason.

I may be dissing this book but you know what I finished all 548 pages in under a week. So definitely entertaining. But lemme go back to dissing it and say it should be illegal to publish a 548 page book that is THE FIRST OF A TRILOGY and not mention that fact somewhere in the book. Ideally it should be in big bold red letters on the cover. I didn’t find out until the book abruptly ended leaving me confused and I looked it up. I do not have the patience to read 2 more books of this neither can I wait for Formula 1 to be good again. Yeah, the drivers are hot and you see tiktok edits of the cars that make it seem cool, maybe you even watch Drive to Survive, but at its core it is nothing but a ball of emptiness surrounded by a deeply evil energy. The only way to consume Formula 1 is to watch it ironically as a metaphor for the downfall of civilization and to keep in mind that to be a fan of anyone involved will inevitably lead to being betrayed by them. You have to watch it with a baseline hatred and skepticism for all the people you see on screen and the sport itself and then you kinda understand.
