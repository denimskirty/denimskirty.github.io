This book is so good. Commonwealth is a joining of countries, this book is about the reluctant joining of two families. Nothing about countries here! Unless you count the formidable nations of Los Angeles and Virginia, where the two families each live. This book was escapism for me. Genuinely the closest I have ever gotten to “chick lit”. A mishmash of multiple definitions of chick lit from the internet is: “a novel typically addressing romantic relationships, female friendships, and workplace struggles in humorous and lighthearted ways to provide both a comforting connection to other women and an escape from reality.” Except, in the case of Commonwealth, take the emphasis off of the “romantic relationships, female friendships,connection to other women” and keep the “addressing struggles in humorous and lighthearted ways to provide both a comforting connection to other people and an escape from reality.” This book doesn’t give the perspective of women in particular, just people in general. And women are people! No diss to chick lit, I just haven’t read a chick fic book that straddles the line between escapism and relatability in a satisfying way. The settings in them aren’t appealing OR relatable, and I feel like a lot of them are too shallow when they’re supposed to be just kinda shallow. This may be due to the fact that the chick lit/fick genre took off during the early 2000s so they have not aged well. (This just reminded me of the book Watermelon by famous Irish chick fic author Marion Keyes which was actually the worst thing I’ve ever read. I wanted a cute romance book where I didn’t need to think, and it ended up somehow being racist, transphobic, pro-life it was actually insane.) I don’t think a chick fic book should be too relatable, that would take away the escapism aspect. It has to be a little romanticized and over-the-top. And Commonwealth fits that bill perfectly. None of the characters look like me and I would never be in their situation. But they are still human enough that I can relate to them. 

I think I have looked down upon chick lit and chick flicks because they portray a very stereotypical view of womanhood and relationships that I don't think is relatable or accurate. But looking at it as a form of escapism, I get that that is the point and I do have an appreciation for them. I wonder what the boy version of a chick lit/flick is. I guess the answer is every other book or movie that isn’t chick lit/flick. Superhero movies, action movies aren’t “gendered” in their audience, having just as much of a female audience as a male one. (I think. I'm not doing research on this.) But chick flicks, chick lit, romcoms, seem to be mostly consumed by women. I think there are parts of them that you have to have experienced or at least have observed a lot of to enjoy. Which sucks because there are messages of relationships, family, and friendship in chick media that superhero movies don’t cover. Girls (as a concept) in general are doing their due diligence watching both but guys aren’t. But I don’t blame them for not wanting to watch 27 Dresses or read Confessions of a Shopaholic or whatever. They just wouldn’t get it a lot of the time. Which is where Commonwealth comes in! I feel like it covers the ideas in chick media without being solely focused on women. This makes zero sense. Too hard to explain. Gender is fake anyway. Basically this book is good and I think literally anyone would enjoy it. Its a book about how love and the unexpected connections between people is weird and hard sometimes but worth it. Basically the best (and only?) message for a book to have. And not cheesy or anything. Basically a message that I hope everyone reads a book about at least once. 

I don’t think chick lit/flicks in the traditional sense are really getting made anymore. But the ones that were made cast a long shadow.

(These are mostly movies not books sorry but movie posters are just more recognizable ok. And a lot of chick flicks were actually based off of books. I’ve only watched one of these and it was 27 Dresses and I watched it on a plane. And guess what it was good I enjoyed it. And also I refuse to include mean girls in here. Mean girls is something else entirely, in a good way) Is chick flick just a kinda sexist and demeaning synonym for rom-com? Idk! That makes even less sense why I got chick lit/flick vibes from Commonwealth because it is not a romantic book at all. I think I accidentally assumed that because the book has nuance when it comes to relationships (familial, friend, romantic) and not that much of a plot (?) that it is just more geared to girls cause boys aren’t that smart in that sense or dont enjoy that type of stuff or something oops. I don’t know if chick flicks are super nuanced either so maybe forget that I ever made that comparison. (This is why these need to be anonymous.)

This book includes neglectful parenting and an allergy that isn’t dealt with well. People (by people I mean [a particular NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/books/review/ann-patchett-commonwealth.html) that I barely skimmed through) calls out this book for being a strickler and telling people how to parent because the neglectful parenting leads to a tragedy. The article implies that Ann Patchett has some kind of agenda about parenting that underlies this book. UH? Just because you write about something doesn’t mean you agree with the moral implications of it. I do think that if you have a fear of allergies because you or someone you care about has a serious allergy you should take discretion in reading this book. Just as when you read any book, you should look at trigger warnings and stuff. It doesn’t mean that any book where someone makes a mistake and there is a negative consequence means that the author is condemning the person that made the mistake and is sending a subliminal message to the reader. The article author also claims that the way the tragedy takes place isn’t scientifically possible. Um who cares. You know why people are reading this book? It’s not to write their PhD dissertation doing clinical research on allergy medication. It’s to read, again, for escapism and relatability. 

I feel like whenever I write one of these I will inevitably google the book, scroll through the results until I see the New York Times article review of it, read it, and then disagree with it and get mad at it. But I’m so glad for that. What’s the point of articles about media that are boring opinion-less summary and filler. We need disagreement and stuff. I hope you disagree with this.
