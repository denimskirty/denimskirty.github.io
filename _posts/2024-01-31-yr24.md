“The airport bestsellers that captured our hearts and ruined our minds.”

This is not about a book, sorry. But it is about a podcast about books! The podcast is called If Books Could Kill. In every episode, the hosts debunk one popular “airport book”. There seems to be 2 categories of airport books they go over, the first being self-help books. This includes self-improvement books (Atomic Habits, The 48 Laws of Power, The Subtle Art of not Giving a F*ck), money books (Rich Dad Poor Dad, Freakonomics, The 4-Hour Workweek, The Art of the Deal), and dating books (The Game, The Rules, The 5 Love Languages). The second category is explaining stuff about the world/society/America books (The Nudge, Bobos in Paradise, The Coddling of the American Mind, Hillbilly Elegy). (I just made up these categories and there is definitely overlap in category with most of these books.) There are 2 hosts, one is named Michael and the other Peter and one is a journalist and the other is a lawyer and their voices are very distinct but I get their names mixed up. (A note: they are liberal/left-leaning. But if the book they’re focusing on in the episode isn’t political, they don’t talk about it.)
 
My parents made me read the book Atomic Habits by James Clear and I remember coming across one of the graphs like wait…something is wrong. Also this is so boring. But, I thought, of course this qualified adult author who has sold millions of copies knows better than me. 

Revisiting Atomic Habits after listening to the If Books Could Kill episode on it, here are a few of the many nothingburger diagrams sprinkled across the book:

Where are the units. You can count repetitions but how do you measure “automaticity”? Also the graph makes absolutely no sense and has no purpose without the caption below the graph. At that point just only include the caption. But we are also getting the same exact information from the actual prose in the book, so what is the point of this figure at all.

What does this mean and why did we need a graph for it. Explain the bunny hops? The caption of the graph explains the concept more concisely (but still arbitrarily and vaguely) while the actual graph makes it way more confusing.

This one is the worst. Compounding? Help. I don’t think human behavioral improvement works like a savings account. How do you measure an exact 1% improvement everyday? After you’ve done this fake 1% improvement everyday for a year, how do you prove that your results are 37 times better than from when you began? Your salary improves 37-fold? You can do 37 times as many pushups? I’m probably doing the math wrong but either way you can’t measure quality of life with percentages. And what even is the curve underneath the dotted line.

Did this really need to take up almost a whole page.

I mean duh. I feel like everyone knows that progress isn’t linear. But I also don’t think it’s exponential like this graph shows??? Like it can be weird and wavy sometimes. I agree with the idea described in the caption, but the graph makes it look stupid and oversimplified.

Girl this is just 3 circles. We could’ve easily visualized this in our brains.

STOP WITH THE CIRCLES. But in addition to being redundant, this one also doesn’t make much sense. Why use circles to represent this? It adds the question of the direction of the arrows.

Again we did not need this as a diagram. Does the author know that lists exist.  

These weird redundant graphs and graphics make it seem like the author just needed to reach a page count. While listening to this podcast I felt justified in knowing that other people read this book and were not impressed. They also talk about other flaws of the book like the real-world examples the author uses that are fraudulent or misconstrued to fit his narrative. I am not a self-help books hater, (totally am. But I’m willing to give the genre another chance!) here's one that I might(!!!) read because a person I follow on goodreads rated it highly and it’s supposed to be “different” from the typical self-help book but then again they all say that: All the Gold Stars by Rainesford Stauffer. 

But probably not anytime soon. This title and cover, although pretty, is already making me feel bad about myself. Maybe this bad feeling is why I like this podcast so much. Maybe some will say it is enabling my lazy woke excuse-ridden gen z external locus of control behavior. But, this podcast is great and Atomic Habits will not be the book to make me change. Whether you have personal beef with any of these books or just want entertainment, listen to If Books Could Kill on Spotify or Apple podcasts.
