Trying to think of topics for this, so here's something: the SAT!!! Ok so last year I read this amazing book: So Nice by Marcy Dermansky! This book is soooo funny. Basically this college student has an inappropriate relationship with her professor, and then he falls in love with her mom! This book is not PG and it is so funny and easy to read. All the chapters are told from povs of different characters, and as the book goes on you see how their lives are entwined. There are themes of politics, race, and class distinctions, but mostly it is about the self-centered-ness of these rich people and how coincidental life can be. None of the characters are good people, and they mostly end up worse by the end of the book. It is not that deep but so fun to read I laughed out loud a few times! Especially at the end. You would never guess how the book ends. Well a hint I guess is that gun control is part of the book and the book ends with the gun but that’s not even the funny/surprising part. (No one dies or gets seriously injured) It ends with a pun basically. Oh gun and pun rhyme! 

Here are some quotes but I don’t think quirky one-liners are what make the book funny, it is the plot as a whole. These quotes are kind of millennial-y but so is the whole book. People make fun of millennials for being cringe or whatever but this book is not cringe. If you know the art that is the show Girls on HBO you will know the vibes.

I had always SUCKED at the reading/writing part of the SAT. The writing (grammar) part I was expecting to be bad at, grammer is always an issue whenever I write something. (You have no idea how much I have to fix these so they don't sound like a robot wrote them. UGH I can't even criticize my own writing by calling it robotic because of chatgpt or whatever. I was the first robot writer! My writing never sounds real. But idrgaf idc about being good at writing.) After doing a bunch of practice tests, the grammar section did improve but the reading section still sucked. This was last year (junior year for me), and when I actually took the test that year my score was ok (? what even is "ok") but I felt meh about it when I saw how much it was just the reading section that was bringing it down. 

I signed up for another SAT, my last chance, which was the Saturday of the first week of school this year (senior year). I had the whole rest of junior year and the entirety of Summer to prepare, guess when I started? 9 PM the day before the test!! Before that, the last time I had seen a SAT question was that time I took the test the previous year. That night, I did like half of a reading section practice in like 20 minutes, didn’t check my answers, and went to bed early to wake up early for the test. I slept like a baby. I was actually pretty calm for some reason before and during taking the test. Scores came back a few weeks later and my reading/writing section improved by 60 points. I only got 2 problems wrong on the reading section. (My math score dropped like a rock but that’s not the point. Also superscore.) 

I know how I improved so much on the SAT, it’s by reading! There’s no other explanation. (I do not want to hear another explanation) I starting reading a lot junior year. Often at times when I was probably supposed to be studying for physics or something. Anyways reading will make you smarter! Not that the SAT is a measure of smartness, it definitely isn't. But reading will make you more sensitive to reading other things, and to words in general. They will make you a better listener, interpreter, and communicator. And the great thing is you can read whatever you want! Reading So Nice by Marcy Dermansky along with other books (of many different genres/kinds) helped me improve my SAT score and grow as a person. It was a lot more entertaining than doing SAT practice, and I don’t think I would’ve experienced a whole lot of growth from doing SAT practice. Kill 2 birds with 1 stone. So Nice also ends with an aphorism. Along with the pun.
