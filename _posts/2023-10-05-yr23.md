Today I finished Irvine Welsh’s “Marabou Stork Nightmares”. This book was a terror and I recommend it to no one who values their eyes or psychological well-being. I don’t mean that it was very sad (though some parts were). It was really just so graphic and damaging that I almost stopped reading the book. That being said, it was really good. 

The story begins with our protagonist (Roy Strang) and his trusty adventuring buddy deep in South Africa, hunting the evasive and dangerous Marabou Stork. Roy has a deep internal calling to rid the continent of this one specific stork, and his buddy doesn’t totally get it, but supports him. This adventuring plotline is interjected with scenes of various people from Roy’s life talking around him as he lies unconscious in a hospital bed. Roy's stream of consciousness in these scenes changes from cheerful literary British English to strings of profanity written in phonetic Scottish English. The rest of the book jumps around between stork hunter Roy and coma Roy, along with flashbacks that get deeper and longer as the book goes on, eventually explaining how he got to where he is. 

Roy grew up in the working class schemes of Scotland with “what was not so much a family as a genetic disaster”. Part of his childhood was spent in South Africa because his Dad was really into the idea of South Africa, but then they had to go back after the Dad fought some guy in a bar. It was in South Africa that he actually saw a Marabou Stork for the first time, and it was where he was repeatedly sexually assaulted by his Dad’s friends (this is very closely tied to the stork for the rest of the book).

For context, here is a Marabou Stork.

They are 5 feet tall and very mean and scary. The stork represents Roy and all of his most violent, malicious, reprehensible acts throughout his life, so he’s trying to kill it in his coma as a sort of redemption to be able to move on and be a good person (that does not happen lol). Apartheid was referenced very heavily throughout the book, and I’m still not sure if Welsh meant it to be just another form of the themes of power and violence within the book, or if he was saying that the basis for Apartheid (like on the innate philosophical level, not politically, economically, etc.) was this specific relationship between power and violence that Roy personifies. I don’t want to do a full breakdown of what I think the book meant, but there’s something in there about dignity and hope and potential, and that when those things are stripped from a person, they seek to hurt others to try to make up for it. There’s also a lot in there about the cycle of abuse, imperialism, and misogyny. Hurt people hurt people pretty much. Maybe this book was not that deep after all idk but it was crazy to read. Welsh did some crazy wacky stuff with type size and formatting that actually worked so well for the story instead of just making it pointlessly harder to read. 

My one word of advice to Irvine Welsh is to be a little less explainy in his writing. He needs to have more confidence. This book was published in 1995, so I hope he has developed a more confident voice. Throughout the book, he adds these wonderfully subtle details and changes that carry things along, but then he (imo) really overuses stream of consciousness to explain Roy’s thought process directly to the reader. You don’t have to do this bb! You already did a good job writing; if you wrote it once you don’t need to write it again!! Ppl will get it I promise!!

All in all, I like how weird it was, both in format and content, and I love an unlikeable protagonist book where the protagonist is genuinely unlikeable (bro explodes a dog and that is so not the worst of it). I wanted to say that the SA scenes were a bit gratuitous in their immense detail and length, but there was nothing romanticized about it at all. If anything, Welsh writes with a soberingly blunt voice that is utterly unglamorous. The scenes were meant to be scary and unpleasant. That’s the point. That sort of thing isn’t easy to do so good job Irvine. I liked this book!
