The book I want to talk about this week is The Scorpio Races by Maggie Steifvater. I read this book last year and I’ve read a bunch of books since, but I’ve been thinking about it. Reason: I’ve recently finished 2 “adult” sci-fi books (Recursion by Blake Crouch and The Deep by Nick Cutter), and though they had interesting plots they could not compete with Maggie Steifvater’s writing for 13 year olds AT ALL. (In my opinion, which is not worth much, I don’t know much about writing.) The Scorpio Races is everything a fantasy YA novel should be in my opinion. It’s set in a beautiful but barren made-up island somewhat resembling Ireland with wild carnivorous horses in the sea which people in the town train to compete in an annual race. The protagonist is a 16 year old girl named Puck and she is the first girl to ever compete. There is romance, but it is very subtle, leading up to (I think?) a kiss at the end of the race. I don’t really remember because I think their relationship as competitors and friends is more prominent than the romance part. There is no love triangle or other popular romance trope (like enemies to lovers etc), basically as soon as the guy shows up you know he and Puck are going to end up together. Just from a technical standpoint by the time he shows up in the book it’s too late to introduce another major character and he’s the only competitor who is her age. And he’s kinda brooding and serious so idk it’s just obvious that they’re gonna end up together no problem or conflict. Plot-wise the book doesn't need those romance tropes bogging it down to make it more “deep” or complex because the main plot line is her getting ready and competing in the race. But even that part is fairly simple and easy to understand. Not simple in a bad way, but simple in a satisfying ending way. That’s the appeal of YA books to older readers I think, if you pick one up you know you will not end up with a plot that you think doesn’t make sense that you google and find out you have to interpret yourself or something, which is fun and great and all but sometimes you don’t want to do all that thinking! (you = me) Sometimes I want to pick up a YA book which I know will adhere to the hero’s arc and leave me with no further questions or a loss of faith in humanity, and that is very comforting! This book just also happens to have some seriously beautiful writing, which is more rare I think. 

Quote from Recursion:  “This low point isn't the book of your life. It's just a chapter.” 🙄🙄😒😒

Quotes from The Deep: “They were slick with the kind of adrenal perspiration that squeezes from the pores like the sweat off foreign cheese.” 🤢🤢🤢😭😭😭

“A drab nothing color—the color you’d get if you scraped a billion thumbprints off a million windowpanes and collected them into a ball.” 😭😭😭WTF does this mean? I keep thinking of this randomly like what does this mean. I have woken up in the middle of the night thinking wtf was he trying to say with this. 

(both of these books had such weird unique complicated plots, these quotes don’t mean they aren’t worth reading.)

Quotes from The Scorpio Races: ….it’s a lot more fun finding bad quotes than it is finding good quotes but if you read it you will definitely see! 


P.S.  The only reason I read The Scorpio Races was because one of my favorite ASMR Youtubers, goodnight moon, said it was her favorite book. She also talked about reading Sense and Sensibility in this video, (I love this video so much) so I bought a copy last Summer in Pittsburg from a used book shop whose original owners I later found out got caught for smuggling and selling 8 million dollars worth of rare books from CMU’s library. That’s irrelevant, but a year has passed and I still have not finished Sense and Sensibility! I read a quarter of it that Summer and then never felt like opening it again. I thought it was boring and the main characters were kinda mean! I WISH I loved it so bad. I am so the kind of person who would enjoy Jane Austen I feel like. I liked Little Women and Wuthering Heights, which are also books written by women from a similar-ish era. I’ve heard Persuasion and Pride and Prejudice are better, more humorous, but I do not know if I feel like trying them anytime soon.
