Here is a poem (it‚Äôs best read aloud imo):

I found this poem on pinterest (how embarrassing!) a long time ago, but every time I read it again I love it so much. I love the line breaks and slashes and italicizing that makes it feel so alive. I always imagine the author's voice as a breathless monologue at the end of a romcom. He‚Äôs drenched in rain and he is desperate to make you understand. There‚Äôs something so charming and immediate about those way-too-specific examples toward the end that even though I never knew her favorite coffee creamer (oat milk maybe?), I know exactly what he‚Äôs saying. It‚Äôs that thing where they throw out all of these hyper-specific details in the 2nd person pov and they all balance out and contextualize one another until that emotional line of best fit emerges. 
If this style has you thinking of that once certain style of tumblr post, it is because the poem is originally from tumblr!! As far as I can tell, Michael Gray exists only on tumblr, and the rest of his poetry exists somewhere too deep in his feed for me to find at this time. If you‚Äôre interested, he has a book of poetry selling on amazon for $9.70. 

In case you‚Äôre not already in the know, pinterest has a comment feature. Under this poem, user Delores left a comment 38 weeks ago: ‚ÄúI am still waiting and wanting that kind of love, at 59 , I don't think it will happen to me.üíî‚Äù I understand you completely, Delores. She has proved our author right, but has also found the terrible little flaw in his doctrine. Love never seems real until it happens to you, but what if it doesn‚Äôt happen to you? What if you are 59 years old and you have a pinterest board for beef casserole recipes and another labeled ‚ÄúType 2 Diabetes Stuff‚Äù and another full of articles about intimacy and ptsd and being the daughter of a narcissistic mother, and you understand what he‚Äôs saying in the poem, and you want that, but it still hasn‚Äôt happened to you? Michael Gray can not guarantee that Delores will ever find love, or that any of us will. Unlike his cheery example of death, love is not inevitable. 

Maybe. Or maybe there is something very deep and sociological and anthropological to be said about our evolutionary instinct to connect with others. Maybe it is in our nature to throw ourselves at people throughout our lives at a rate such that it would be statistically improbable to never experience love even once. Maybe it is inevitable, and we‚Äôre just too caught up in finding it in a specific form that we don't even know it when we finally have it.   
I didn‚Äôt realize I loved my friends until long after I‚Äôd started loving them. It wasn‚Äôt so much a sweeping fall into lovesick adoration as a settling; as an ease that doesn‚Äôt exist anywhere else. Every once in a while I get genuinely emotional over my admiration for and trust in them in much the way that Michael Gray describes. Maybe this poem does not belong in a rom com. Love is everywhere. I think that Delores probably has people that love her. I dove further into her pinterest, hoping to find some suggestion of family or friends. I thought I found some evidence of her having young children or grandchildren but I fear it was in fact inappropriate stuff. I don't want to elaborate on the SFL email. 

Anyway! Sorry to put pinterest user Delores‚Äô personal life on blast like that. I‚Äôm assuming none of you are her. Also sorry for getting soppy in this one. Do you think Michael Gray is right? Do you think Delores will find love in her life? Do you love anyone? Do you feel loved by them?
